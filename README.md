1.   Board Initialization: 
   * Default board size: 4x4. 
   * Start with two random tiles with values 2 or 4. 
2.   Game Mechanics: 
   * Players can slide tiles up, down, left, or right using keyboard or GUI controls.
   * Tiles with the same number merge into one tile with their sum.
   *  After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears at a random empty position.
   *  Game ends when either:
      > Player reaches 2048, or
      > No more moves are possible.
